In order to begin making the settings, we need to have the following elements:

## Necessary resources

- SmartCom PRO ETH with all its cables and connectors.
- An Inepro Metering PRO380-Mb.
- An electric cable with the one that appears in the image.
- Two screwdrivers, one of star and another plane, small.

3. Connect the other end of the cable to the Inepro Metering PRO380-Mb **as shown in the image**, follow the color pattern. The cables must be connected to the **output L1** or terminals 18/19. This is where the meter sends the data to the SmartCom so they can be read and registered in the Enectiva system. The value of the sent pulse is **R<sub>L</sub>=0,1Wh/imp**.
